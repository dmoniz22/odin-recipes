    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A delicious recipe of Portuguese marinated pork loin chops. Often served in bread but can be enjoyed on their own</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 pounds thinly sliced pork top round, or cutlets, or thin-sliced boneless pork chops, trimmed of fat</li>
        <li>1 & 1/2 cups white wine</li>
        <li>6 garlic cloves, chopped</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves, broken in half</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white wine vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sweet paprika</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Diamond kosher salt, (or 1 1/4 teaspoon Morton kosher salt)</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons lard</li>
        <li>Papo secos or crusty rolls, to serve</li>
        <li>piri-piri sauce, for serving (optional)</li>
        <li>mustard</li> 
    </ul>
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li>Slip a slice of top round, a pork cutlet, or pork chop into a zip-top bag or between two pieces of plastic wrap and pound it with a meat tenderizer or rolling pin until it's very thin but not torn. Ideally, you want it to be the thickness of deli meat, less than 1/8 of an inch (3mm) thick. Repeat with the rest of the pork</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, stir together the 1 1/2 cups white wine, 6 garlic cloves, 2 bay leaves, 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar, 1 tablespoon sweet paprika, and 2 teaspoons Diamond kosher salt</li>
        <li>Add the pork slices to a shallow pan and pour the marinade over top. Stir the pork in the liquid, making sure the slices are pretty much submerged. Refrigerate the pan for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, stirring the meat several times</li>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat until very hot and add the 3 tablespoons lard. Fry the bifanas quickly until cooked through, about 1 minute per side. Add more lard if the pan threatens to dry out. Transfer the cooked bifanas to a plate</li>
        <li>Discard the bay leaves and pour the reserved marinade into the skillet and scrape up any stuck-on bits. Let the mixture boil until reduced by about 1/3, 4 to 6 minutes</li>
        <li>Add the bifanas back to the skillet, reduce the heat to low, and simmer to warm them through</li>
        <li>Slice the Papo secos or crusty rolls in half. Spoon some of the sauce over each half, pile with the pork, and, if desired, serve with the mustard and piri-piri sauce</li>
    </ol>
